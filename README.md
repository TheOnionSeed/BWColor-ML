# BWColor-ML

- The aim of the project is to create a cloud service that can continuously train a neural network model on coloring black and white images. We will do this by scraping online for data.

- We will have a web interface to interact and test the model as well.

- Language: Python 3.8.2

- Requirements
    pip install numpy
    pip install matplotlib
    pip install opencv-python
