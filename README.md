# Handwritten-ML

- The aim of the project is to create a cloud service that can continuously train a machine learning model on detecting handwritten texts(reading texts in general). We will do this by scraping online for data.

- We will have a web interface to interact and test the model as well.

- Language: Python 3.8.2
