# BWColor-ML

- The aim of the project is to create a cloud service that can continuously train a neural network model on coloring black and white images. We will do this by scraping online for data.

- We will have a web interface to interact and test the model as well.

- We will create a model as per the main reference. We will extend it so that we can train with more datasets.

- Language: Python 3.6

## Requirements

- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `tensorflow` currently left unsatisfied for `ObjDetect.py` - this is a known issue
